*** Readme File for hsqldbmin.jar shipping with IAIK jTSS ***

jTSS ships with a HSQL binary, which is built from the HSQL source using the 
minimum configuration 'jarmin'.  

* LICENSE *
See file HSQLDN_LICENSE for license information.

* RECOMPILING hsqldbmin.jar *

To recompile HSQLDB, download the latest version from http://www.hsqldb.org/ ,
go to the build directory and build it with 'ant jarmin'. This will create 
the hsqldbmin.jar, which is suitable for our needs, in the libs folder.

If you want to make the jar file smaller, you can additionally exclude 
org/hsqldb/DatabaseInformationFull.class in the build.xml file at the target
'hsqldbmin'. Though, this will make it only a few KB smaller.
